Overview
----------
- **Languages**: C++

This program is a command-line file compressor and decompressor that implements Huffman's algorithm and extends the basic I/O functionality of C++ to include bitwise operations.

Instructions
----------
Compression and decompression can be invoked as follows:

- Compression: **./compress *A* *B***
- Decompression: **./uncompress *B* *C***

Where ***A*** is the infile (e.g. warandpeace.txt), ***B*** is the outfile name  (e.g. compressed.txt) as well as the uncompression input, and ***C*** is the  uncompression output (e.g. uncompressed.txt) which will be the same as ***A***
