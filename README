compress
uncompress

This program is a Huffman code file compressor and decompressor written in C++
It implements Huffman's algorithm using supporting data structures and extends
the basic I/O functionality of C++ to include bitwise operations

This program can be invoked with a command line:

Compression: ./compress A B
Uncompression: ./uncompress B C

Where A is the infile (e.g. warandpeace.txt), B is the outfile name 
(e.g. compressed.txt) as well as the uncompression input, and C is the 
uncompression output (e.g. uncompressed.txt) which will be the same as A
